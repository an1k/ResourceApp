Whatever module you make push under mainApp folder 
name ur module. under that keep all the classes and packages. whatever u need.


phoenix module contains all the utility classes, POJOs and middleware like classes.
contains File and XML interaction classes for caching files form server.

Planning to implement java webservices to provide content. 
deciding on the availability of help for this thinking of migrating to PHP for easier code maintainance. the template remains the same.
Let me know in case of any donation made to the code or whatsoever. I havent got time to work on this since last update. looking forward to some help.



Note: keep all the stuff under com.resource.app
this s VERY VERY important.
